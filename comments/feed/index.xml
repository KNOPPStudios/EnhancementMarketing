					<description><![CDATA[MARC! First of all, I don&#039;t know why I didn&#039;t see the flag from the system that this assignment had been submitted. That, too, appears broken.
But I can&#039;t tell you how much I was shaking my head the entire time I was reading your submission. I&#039;ve imported cars between Canada and the US multiple times. And it&#039;s just... well... it&#039;s just a pain in the ass. I stopped doing it.
GREAT one.]]></description>

Length is comfortable, everything about it works.
Great stuff.]]></description>
